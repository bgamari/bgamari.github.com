<p>In Lori Goldner’s group I am working to broaden the applicability of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) as a tool for probing biomolecular systems. With this tool, I examine the geometry and flexibility of nucleic acid polymers such as DNA and RNA.</p>
<p>Building off of a technique developed by Goldner at the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>, we use colloidal droplets as a means of containing fluorescently labelled molecules. By way of a novel particle tracking system, we can observe single-molecules contained within a droplet for minutes at time, greatly extending the timescales accessible to FRET.</p>
<p>By applying tools developed in the fields of statistics and machine learning, I seek to draw more meaningful and efficient inferences from experimental data. I use probabilistic graphical models along with Bayesian inference to construct generative models of experimental data. This generative modelling approach enables me to account for a variety of phenomena in a principled yet computationally tractable manner.</p>
<p>While FRET provides a useful view into the slow fluctuations and large changes of a molecule, resolution of fast dynamics, particularly of the fluorophores themselves, is well beyond the abilities of the technique. These dynamics can often have significant implications on the information content of a molecule’s dynamics found in data. We employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to shed light on these fast processes, allowing us to more effectively understand the applicability of our inferences.</p>
<p>I feel that open access to hardware and software is essential for an open and reproducible scientific dialogue. For this reason, I have designed and implemented an inexpensive yet flexible hardware <a href="http://goldnerlab.physics.umass.edu/wiki/FpgaTimeTagger">time-tagger</a> built around an off-the-shelf FPGA for use in single-photon counting applications. The design and associated software is available under an open-source license and serves as the primary data acquisition platform for my experimental work.</p>
