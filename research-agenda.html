<p>I am working to further understanding of the applicability of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer">FRET</a>) as a tool for probing biomolecular systems. With this tool, I examine the geometry and flexibility of nucleic acid polymers such as DNA and RNA in <a href="http://people.umass.edu/lgoldner/goldner.html">Lori Goldner’s</a> single-molecule biophysics group.</p>
<h3 id="droplets-for-single-molecule-confinement">Droplets for single-molecule confinement</h3>
<p>One of the most common realizations of FRET experiment is by study of labelled freely-diffusing molecules under a common light microscope. While this approach can give details of kinetics and geometry for an ensemble, it is severely limited in its ability to study single specimens especially over long durations.</p>
<p>Building off of a technique developed by Goldner at the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>, we use colloidal droplets as a means of containing fluorescently labelled molecules. By way of a novel particle tracking system, we can observe single-molecules contained within a droplet for minutes at time, greatly extending the timescales accessible to single-molecule FRET.</p>
<h3 id="better-analysis-for-better-inferences">Better analysis for better inferences</h3>
<p>By applying tools developed in the fields of statistics and machine learning, I seek to draw more meaningful and efficient inferences from experimental data. I use probabilistic graphical models along with Bayesian inference to construct generative models for photon data. This generative approach enables me to account for a variety of phenomena in a principled yet computationally tractable manner.</p>
<p>While FRET provides a useful view into the slow fluctuations and large changes of a molecule, resolution of fast dynamics, particularly of the fluorophores themselves, is well beyond the reach of the technique. These dynamics can often have significant implications on the information content of the resulting experimental data. We employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to shed light on these fast processes, allowing us to more effectively understand the applicability of our inferences.</p>
<h3 id="science-should-be-open">Science should be open</h3>
<p>I feel that open access to hardware and software is essential for an open and reproducible scientific dialogue. For this reason, I have designed and implemented an inexpensive yet flexible hardware <a href="http://goldnerlab.physics.umass.edu/wiki/FpgaTimeTagger">time-tagger</a> built around an off-the-shelf FPGA for use in single-photon counting applications. The design and associated software is available under an open-source license and serves as the primary data acquisition platform for my experimental work.</p>
<p>Additionally, all of my analysis code can be found on the group <a href="http://goldnerlab.physics.umass.edu/git/index.cgi">git repository</a>. While time constraints often make it challenging to thoroughly document each of my tools, I strive to at very least release source. If you are interested in any of the projects you find, don’t hesitate to send me an email.</p>
