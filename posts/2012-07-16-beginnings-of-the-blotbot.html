<p>Over the last several weeks, various graduate students and I have been reflecting on the role (or perhaps lack thereof) of open source hardware in the fields of physical science research.</p>
<p>Among other things, this has lead to the UMass Open Science Hardware Workshop which took place last Saturday, which brought together folks from around UMass (as well as some coming from out of state; thanks for coming!) to discuss the capabilities, advantages, and challenges of using open source hardware and software in a research setting. While this was great, I’ll leave this for another time.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about today is a small project introduced to me by (Don Blair)[http://www.donblair.cc/] which I think represents an obvious entry point for open source hardware in the life sciences. Like many in biological physics, I try to avoid systems requiring tedious preparation. That being said, it’s difficult to avoid chemistry altogether and I have spend a fair number of hours with Pipetman in hand. Consequently, I can appreciate the pain that biologists must endure to perform a (Western blot)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blot]. This experiment is one of a class of techniques ubiquitous in the life sciences which require perfectly intelligent, able-minded graduate students to perform repetitive tasks only fit for a trained monkey.</p>
<p>Don and I feel this class of experiment should no longer wreck havoc on the lives of unsuspecting students, lab technicians, and post-docs. As a result, we’ve been reflecting on ways to make these techniques just slightly less painful. In keeping with our shared belief in the strength of open ideas, we intend to continue this exploration in the open.</p>
<p>The current focus of our efforts is a machine which we have termed the Blot Bot. Whether it will be useful for Western blots remains to be seen, but it is a solid step towards an open platform for automating multi-step chemical processes.</p>
